# dev-website
Site vitrine (TOP)

Hello !

With this project, I'll go with all the skills I learned last month and try to make my first website, presenting my projects and CV.

For this project, I'll use only vanilla HTML and CSS for now. 
The website will be displayed in french for the moment, I'll try to translate it later.

This project is part of the Foundations course by The Odin Project.

Thoughts after completing this projects (the TOP assignement part at least): 
- I had 'padding' to each section to avoid space between those, but it makes more difficult to get proportional heights for example. I have to find an other way to do that. 
- I'd love to add some animations effects, I'll go back on this later.
- I love this color palette but I think it's not the best for someone's eyes... Maybe I could rearrange all of it.
