# dev-website
Site vitrine (TOP)

Hello !

With this project, I'll go with all the skills I learned last month and try to make my first website, presenting my projects and CV.

For this project, I'll use only vanilla HTML and CSS for now. 
The website will be displayed in french for the moment, I'll try to translate it later.

This project is part of the Foundations course by The Odin Project.
